# ⭐ The Governance Benchmarking Atlas — Master Table Architecture

This is the **spine** of the atlas. Everything plugs into it.

 **Three layers** are essential:

---

# **Layer 1 — Domain Master Tables (10 axes × entities)**  
Each domain gets its own table, always in the same format:

### **Domain X — [Name] Benchmark Table**

| Entity / System | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | A6 | A7 | A8 | A9 | A10 | Overall | Δ |
|-----------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|---------|----|
| System 1        |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |    |
| System 2        |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |    |
| …               |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |    |

**Why this works:**  
- Every domain is comparable.  
- You can add new systems anytime.  
- You can leave blanks for future benchmarking.  
- You can freeze ISA Fabric at the top as the reference.

---

# **Layer 2 — Cross‑Domain Matrix (Representative Systems)**  
This is the “map of the map.”

### **Cross‑Domain Matrix (Representative Systems)**

| Domain | Representative System | A1 | A4 | A5 | A6 | A9 | A10 | Overall |
|--------|------------------------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|---------|
| DAOs   | Optimism               |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |
| Corporate | UK Code            |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |
| Protocols | Ethereum           |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |
| Constitutions | Germany        |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |
| DFIR   | NIST 800‑53           |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |
| Finance | ECB                  |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |
| AI     | Anthropic             |    |    |    |    |    |     |         |

**Why this works:**  
- You can instantly see cross‑domain patterns.  
- You can swap in different representatives later.  
- You can add new domains without breaking structure.

---

# **Layer 3 — Microscope Pass Tables (60‑vertex detail)**  
This is where you drill down into a single system.

### **Microscope Table — System X (60 vertices)**

| Axis | Vertex | Score | Rationale |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| A1   | V1.1   |        |           |
| A1   | V1.2   |        |           |
| …    | …      |        |           |
| A10  | V10.6  |        |           |

**Why this works:**  
- You can add microscope passes for any system at any time.  
- You can compare microscope tables across domains.  
- You can leave blank rows for future vertex scoring.

# ⭐ The Key Insight  
You don’t need to rewrite anything.  
You don’t need to reorganize the content.  
You simply need to **create the empty scaffolding** for:

- 7 Domain Tables  
- 1 Cross‑Domain Matrix  
- Unlimited Microscope Tables  
- Unlimited Triangulation Tables  
- Unlimited Stress‑Test Tables  

And then **slot in** what is already generated.

This gives a clean, powerful benchmarking instrumentation to operate and perform simulated and/or real-world benchmarks:

- A **living atlas**  
- A **frozen coordinate system**  
- A **future‑proof structure**  
- A **place for every new governance system**  
- A **clean way to publish v1.0**  

---


**Here is a fully‑populated master reference table PLUS a clean, empty, future‑ready template.**

This gives you:

- A **canonical reference** (everything we’ve built so far in one place)  
- A **blank atlas scaffold** (ready for new domains, new systems, new versions)  
- A **repeatable structure** that future contributors can follow without ambiguity  
- A **frozen geometry** for the Governance Benchmarking Lattice v1.0  

Below is exactly that:  
1) **The Full Cross‑Domain Master Table (populated)**  
2) **The Blank Cross‑Domain Template (future‑ready)**  
3) **The Blank Domain Table Template (per‑domain)**  
4) **The Blank Microscope Table Template (60‑vertex)**  

This is the cleanest, most extensible structure for the atlas.

# ⭐ 3) BLANK DOMAIN TABLE TEMPLATE (PER‑DOMAIN)

This is the template for each domain’s full benchmarking table.

### **Domain X — Benchmark Table Template**

| Entity / System | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | A6 | A7 | A8 | A9 | A10 | Overall | Δ |

# ⭐ 4) BLANK MICROSCOPE TABLE TEMPLATE (60‑VERTEX)

This is the template for deep‑drill analysis of any single system.

### **Microscope Table — System X (60‑Vertex Template)**

| Axis | Vertex | Score | Rationale |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| A1   | V1.1   |        |           |
| A1   | V1.2   |        |           |
| A1   | V1.3   |        |           |
| A1   | V1.4   |        |           |
| A1   | V1.5   |        |           |
| A1   | V1.6   |        |           |
| A2   | V2.1   |        |           |
| …    | …      |        |           |
| A10  | V10.6  |        |           |

This is the**microscope** — the serpent’s tongue of benchmarking.

---

*****Below are the templates to exercise benchmark's with, including instruction thereof:

- A **full reference table**  
- A **blank cross‑domain template**  
- A **blank domain template**  
- A **blank microscope template**  

This is the **Governance Benchmarking Atlas v1.0 scaffolding**.


This is the exact prescription and instuction:

# ⭐ The Microscope (“Serpent’s Tongue”) **does NOT need a separate slot for the entity name.**  
It is **implicitly** the table *for that one entity*.  
The table itself **is the slot**.

Think of it like this:

- The **Domain Table** compares many systems → so each row needs a system name.  
- The **Cross‑Domain Matrix** compares representatives → so each row needs a system name.  
- The **Microscope Table** is *not* a comparison. It is a **deep dive into one system only** → so the table doesn’t need a “System” column.

Instead, the **title** of the microscope table *is* the slot for the entity.

Example:

```
Microscope Table — Optimism Collective (60‑Vertex Analysis)
```

Then the table begins:

| Axis | Vertex | Score | Rationale |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| A1   | V1.1   | 8      | ...       |
| A1   | V1.2   | 7      | ...       |
| …    | …      | …      | …         |

No need for a “System” column because the entire table is already scoped to that one system.

# ⭐ Why this is the correct design  
The Microscope is:

- **Not comparative**  
- **Not multi‑row**  
- **Not multi‑entity**  
- **Not domain‑level**  

It is a **single‑entity, 60‑vertex diagnostic**.

So the structure is:

### **Microscope Table — [Entity Name]**

| Axis | Vertex | Score | Rationale |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| …    | …      | …      | …         |

That’s it.  
Clean.  
Frozen.  
Unambiguous.  
Future‑proof.

# ⭐ If a benchmarking was desired to compare a two microscope pass side‑by‑side  
Then you would create a **Tri‑Microscope Table** or **Dual‑Microscope Table**, and *those* would need system names in the rows or columns.

But the **Serpent’s Tongue** itself is always **one entity → 60 vertices**.

# ⭐ TL;DR  
**The Microscope table doesn’t need a slot for the entity.  
The title *is* the slot.  
The table is only for scores + rationale.**


Hare are **all three structures** to be applied to the lattice and built cleanly and ready to drop into the atlas:

- **1) The perfected Microscope Template (single‑entity, 60‑vertex)**  
- **2) The Dual‑Microscope Comparison Template (two entities side‑by‑side)**  
- **3) The Tri‑Microscope Comparison Template (three entities in parallel)**  

These are the “precision instruments” of the atlas — the tools that let you zoom in, compare, and diagnose governance systems with surgical clarity.

---

# ⭐ 1) **Microscope Template — “The Serpent’s Tongue”**  
### *Single‑Entity, 60‑Vertex Deep Diagnostic*

This is the **canonical** microscope table.  
It is always scoped to **one system**, so the title *is* the slot for the entity.

# ⭐ 2) **Dual‑Microscope Comparison Template**  
### *Two systems, vertex‑by‑vertex, side‑by‑side*

This is for comparing two governance systems at the deepest level.

### **Dual‑Microscope Comparison — [ENTITY A] vs [ENTITY B]**

| Axis | Vertex | [ENTITY A] Score | [ENTITY B] Score | Notes / Interpretation |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| A1   | V1.1   |                   |                   |                        |
| A1   | V1.2   |                   |                   |                        |
| …    | …      |                   |                   |                        |

This is ideal for:

- DAO vs DAO  
- Constitution vs Constitution  
- AI governance vs AI governance  
- Or cross‑domain comparisons like Ethereum vs Germany

# ⭐ 3) **Tri‑Microscope Comparison Template**  
### *Three systems in parallel — the triangulation instrument*

This is the structure used conceptually for Ethereum vs Germany vs Anthropic.  
Now there is the formal table.

### **Tri‑Microscope Comparison — [ENTITY A] vs [ENTITY B] vs [ENTITY C]**

| Axis | Vertex | [ENTITY A] | [ENTITY B] | [ENTITY C] | Interpretation |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| A1   | V1.1   |             |             |             |                |

These new benchmarking tools are the tools that can be applied in the process of benchmarking with the lattice:

- The **Serpent’s Tongue** (single‑entity microscope)  
- The **Dual‑Microscope** (two‑entity comparison)  
- The **Tri‑Microscope** (three‑entity triangulation)  

These are the **precision instruments** of the Governance Benchmarking Atlas.
