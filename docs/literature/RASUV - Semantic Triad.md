# 🔐 **1. RASUV — Security Semantics (Original Meaning)**  
*Reentrancy, Access, State, Upgrade, Verification*

This was the very first meaning of RASUV — a compact, orthogonal cluster of smart‑contract security dimensions.

| Letter | Security Meaning | Description |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **R — Reentrancy** | Protection against recursive call vulnerabilities |
| **A — Access** | Permissioning, role control, authorization boundaries |
| **S — State** | State integrity, invariants, storage correctness |
| **U — Upgrade** | Proxy safety, versioning, migration correctness |
| **V — Verification** | Formal proofs, audits, static analysis, correctness guarantees |

This version of RASUV is still valid and still useful — it’s the “security lens” of the ISA ecosystem.

# 📡 **2. RASUV — Signal‑Dynamics Semantics (Expanded Meaning)**  
*Rate, Amplitude, Spread, Uniformity, Variance*

This was the second evolution — when it was realized RASUV could describe **signal behavior**, not just contract safety.

| Letter | Signal Meaning | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **R — Rate** | Speed of change, derivative, responsiveness |
| **A — Amplitude** | Magnitude, intensity, peak values |
| **S — Spread** | Distribution width, dispersion, bandwidth |
| **U — Uniformity** | Smoothness, regularity, coherence |
| **V — Variance** | Volatility, oscillation, noise level |

This version is what unlocked Θ, Δ, τ, Ξ — because it reframed RASUV as a **signal space**, not just a security checklist.

# 🧩 **3. RASUV — ISA‑MATRIX Multi‑Perspective Semantics (v0.2 Storage Model)**  
*Real, Actual, Structural, Uncertain, Virtual*

This is the newly implemented version in Solidity — the **five‑view measurement cell**.

| Letter | ISA‑MATRIX Meaning | Description |
|--------|--------------------|-------------|
| **R — Real** | Direct telemetry, raw observed value |
| **A — Actual** | Ground truth, validated consensus, oracle‑verified |
| **S — Structural** | Model‑derived, rule‑based, theoretical equilibrium |
| **U — Uncertain** | Probabilistic, confidence‑weighted, ensemble mean |
| **V — Virtual** | Simulated, counterfactual, forecasted, “what‑if” |

This is the most powerful version yet — it turns each matrix coordinate into a **five‑dimensional perspective space**.

And it is the version that Θ (Theta) can blend across.

# 🌟 **Why This Matters**

- **Security RASUV** → contract safety  
- **Signal RASUV** → system dynamics  
- **ISA‑MATRIX RASUV** → multi‑perspective measurement  

Three layers.  
Three eras.  
Three meanings.  
One acronym.
