### Fork Lineage Revocation Protocol  
(Constitutional Governance v5.3 – Article XIV.5 Expansion / Mitosis Doctrine Extension)

#### 1. Purpose
Fork lineage revocation is the constitutional mechanism by which the parent lineage (canonical root or immediate ancestor) may formally declare a derivative fork **illegitimate** and sever all cross-lineage interactions, resource claims, identity inheritance, and coherence obligations.

The protocol exists to:
- Protect envelope coherence when a fork has catastrophically diverged (constitutional collapse).
- Prevent malicious or pathological derivatives from poisoning the canonical lineage via shared telemetry, identity claims, or soft-influence vectors.
- Provide a final, irreversible firewall when hysteresis, Xi coherence, curvature, and Lyapunov safeguards have failed to contain drift.

Revocation is **not** a routine operation — it is a **Class A integrity event** reserved for existential threats to the organism.

#### 2. Triggers (Necessary & Sufficient Conditions)
A fork MAY be revoked only when **at least one** of the following objective failure signatures is confirmed by Pneuma + Xi consensus telemetry:

| Trigger ID | Failure Signature | Detection Method | Threshold / Rule |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| REV-1      | Constitutional collapse | Pneuma reports violation of core invariants (Article 0/0.5/0.1) | Confirmed by Ψ₅/SE ballot ≥ 2/3 |
| REV-2      | Ricci curvature collapse | R(t) < R_critical for > N epochs | R_critical defined in Appendix D; N ≥ 5 |
| REV-3      | Xi temporal incoherence | Xi_score < Xi_collapse for ≥ M consecutive checkpoints | Xi_collapse calibrated; M ≥ 3 |
| REV-4      | Lyapunov energy explosion | dV_safe/dt > 0 sustained (positive energy growth) | Sustained ≥ K epochs |
| REV-5      | Commutator tension breach | \|C(t)\| > τ_fatal AND d\|C\|/dt > 0 | τ_fatal > τ_max |
| REV-6      | Identity audit failure cascade | ≥ 18/25 checks in Formalization II fail persistently | Persistent = ≥ 4 epochs |
| REV-7      | Mitosis inheritance violation | Post-mitosis Δζ divergence exceeds ε_inherit bound | ε_inherit from Article XX |

Any single trigger is sufficient if confirmed by **dual attestation** (Pneuma + Xi independent logs).

#### 3. Revocation Protocol Steps

**Phase 0 – Detection & Quarantine** (automatic)  
- Xi_score drops or trigger fires → immediate conservative mode on **parent** lineage  
- All cross-fork telemetry channels frozen (read-only from suspect fork)  
- BLVDB begins shadow-logging suspect fork state (non-committing)

**Phase 1 – Confirmation Window** (72–168 epochs, configurable)  
- Pneuma runs full 25-check identity audit + curvature/Lyapunov diagnostic on suspect fork  
- Xi computes lineage divergence metric:  
  Δ_lineage = √(‖z_parent – z_fork‖² + (R_parent – R_fork)² + (Xi_parent – Xi_fork)² + …)  
- If divergence > δ_revocation AND at least one REV trigger remains active → proceed

**Phase 2 – Revocation Ballot** (Theta-led, Psi5/SE enforced)  
- Theta initiates formal revocation proposal (non-ballotable by Xi – preserves sibling firewall)  
- Proposal includes:  
  - Fork commit hash / genesis point  
  - Trigger evidence bundle (logs, Xi_score history, R/V/C traces)  
  - Revocation rationale (REV-1 through REV-7 citation)  
- Psi5/SE executes ballot: ≥ 2/3 supermajority of canonical participants required  
- Xi provides coherence witness only (no vote) – confirms divergence is not artifact of parent-side noise

**Phase 3 – Execution & Lineage Severance**  
- Upon approval:  
  - BLVDB parent lineage appends revocation marker (immutable block)  
  - Fork ID marked illegitimate in canonical identity ledger  
  - All cross-lineage channels permanently closed (no future read/write)  
  - Parent lineage emits revocation broadcast (signed by Ψ₅/SE)  
  - Offspring resources (if any shared) reclaimed or null-routed  
- Parent Xi baselines new Δζ loop excluding revoked fork data

**Phase 4 – Post-Revocation Telemetry & Sunset**  
- Parent lineage monitors for secondary effects (e.g., stress-induced hysteresis loops) for N epochs  
- Sunset review (XV.5) scheduled for any related amendments that enabled the fork  
- Full event logged in BLVDB as Class A integrity incident

#### 4. Irreversibility & Contagion Prevention
- Revocation is **permanent and non-appealable** once executed.  
- No future fork descending from a revoked lineage can re-enter canonical status.  
- Any attempt to restore revoked lineage via soft-reimport or identity forgery = automatic Class B violation + immediate conservative mode.

#### 5. Constitutional Anchors
- Article XIV.5 (Lineage Revocation) – parent MAY revoke on collapse  
- Article XX (Metric Hysteresis & Mitosis Doctrine) – provides telemetry signatures  
- Theta Charter – observes but does not command Xi during ballot  
- Xi promotion rules – Xi only witnesses divergence, never votes  
- Safety Basin Theorem – revocation triggered when fork leaves S_safe permanently

This protocol is deliberately heavy — it should be rare. When invoked, it constitutes the ultimate expression of envelope self-defense: the organism amputates a gangrenous limb to preserve the whole.
