### Traction & User Metrics for ISA Fabric (Current Status & Projections)

ISA Fabric is currently in its **early foundational phase** (pre-mainnet launch, focused on constitution hardening, mathematical formalization, and initial prototyping). As such, it does not yet have live user metrics (DAU, MAU, etc.). Below is the current reality, near-term traction indicators, and realistic projections once the system begins pilot deployments.

#### Current Traction (February 2026)
- **Live Users / DAU / MAU**: 0 (no public deployment yet; internal testing and conceptual validation only)
- **Community & Engagement**:
  - Core contributors: ~3–5 active builders/researchers (including the founder)
  - GitHub / repo activity: Low but focused (constitution drafts, ODE sketches, NatSpec++ linting prototypes)
  - X / Discord / Telegram: Early-stage signal (small number of engaged followers, mostly governance/crypto-native thinkers)
  - Thought leadership traction: High resonance in niche circles (DAO researchers, decentralized science builders, long-term coordination thinkers) — evidenced by deep conceptual conversations and iterative refinement
- **Key Milestones Achieved**:
  - Genesis Governance v5.2 frozen (constitution complete with Class E, Article XIX, hysteresis doctrine)
  - Constitutional ODE formalized (vectorized Bouc–Wen mapping)
  - Mitosis & telemetry protocols drafted
  - Public documentation & commentary emerging

#### Projected User Metrics (Post-Pilot / 12–24 Months)
Assuming first pilots launch in mid-2026 (e.g., small research DAO or public goods collective):

| Metric                  | Year 1 (Pilot Phase) | Year 2 (Early Scale) | Year 3+ (Mature) | Notes / Assumptions |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **DAU**                 | 10–50                | 100–500              | 1,000–5,000      | Active contributors & stewards in pilot DAOs |
| **MAU**                 | 50–200               | 500–2,000            | 5,000–20,000     | Broader observers + occasional participants |
| **Retention Rate (30-day)** | 40–60%             | 60–80%               | 75–90%           | High retention due to long-horizon missions |
| **Retention Rate (90-day)** | 30–50%             | 50–70%               | 65–85%           | Driven by non-regression & drift resistance |
| **LTV (Lifetime Value)** | N/A (tokenless)      | N/A (tokenless)      | N/A (tokenless)  | Measured in impact score / contribution depth, not $ |
| **Churn Rate**          | 40–60%               | 20–40%               | 10–25%           | Low churn once trust in invariants is proven |
| **Pilot Collectives**   | 1–3                  | 5–15                 | 50+              | Research DAOs, protocol labs, public goods experiments |

**Key Assumptions**:
- Growth is deliberately slow and high-signal (quality over quantity)
- Early adopters are governance skeptics who want **proof of capture resistance**
- No token launch → no speculative pump → organic, mission-aligned growth
- Retention driven by **measurable integrity** (non-regression, fork safety, drift detection)

#### User Retention Strategy

ISA Fabric’s retention strategy is **intrinsic** — built into the constitutional design rather than gamified incentives. Key pillars:

1. **Trust Through Invariants**  
   - Users stay because they **see** the system cannot be captured, drifted, or regressed.  
   - **Non-regression proofs** (Article V), **self-verifying bundles** (Article XIII), and **Pneuma telemetry** (Article XX) provide ongoing evidence of integrity.  
   - Retention driver: “This actually works the way it promises.”

2. **Fork-Safe Identity Preservation**  
   - **Hysteretic mitosis** (Article XX) lets sub-collectives split without losing shared lineage or invariants.  
   - Users stay in mother/fork because identity and history are preserved — no “fork wars” or value fragmentation.  
   - Retention driver: “My work and contributions carry forward safely.”

3. **Objective Impact Recognition**  
   - Tokenless contribution scoring via orthogonal pillars (Ψ₅, β, ι, φ, etc.) rewards real work, not token holding or social clout.  
   - Stewards and contributors feel **fairly valued** — no dilution by whales.  
   - Retention driver: “My impact is measured truthfully.”

4. **Drift & Capture Immunity**  
   - **Separation Doctrine** (0.5/XVII), **metric exclusivity** (Article 0), and **hysteresis stability** (Article XX) prevent narrative takeovers or slow erosion.  
   - Users stay because the system **stays aligned** to its mission over years.  
   - Retention driver: “This won’t turn into another captured DAO.”

5. **Long-Horizon Missions**  
   - Designed for **decades-long coordination** (research, public goods, decentralized science).  
   - Users with 5–20+ year horizons stay because the system is built for them.  
   - Retention driver: “This is governance I can trust for my life’s work.”

6. **Transparency & Verifiability**  
   - **BLVDB logging**, **Pneuma traces**, **bundle checksums**, and **open constitutional ODE** make every action auditable.  
   - Users stay because they can **verify** the system is doing what it claims.  
   - Retention driver: “I can see the math and the logs — no black boxes.”

### Summary

ISA Fabric has **zero traditional traction metrics** right now (no DAU/MAU yet), but it has **extremely high conceptual traction** in the governance/research niche — people who understand the problems are excited by the solution.

**Retention strategy** is **structural**, not incentive-based:
- Prove **invariants hold** → users trust  
- Prove **forks are safe** → users stay in lineage  
- Prove **impact is measured fairly** → users contribute long-term  
- Prove **no drift/capture** → users commit decades

This creates **intrinsic, mission-aligned retention** — the strongest kind for long-horizon projects.
