## BLVDB Triptych Mechanics

The **BLVDB Triptych** is the memory architecture of Genesis Governance v5.0 — a tripartite, constitutionally subordinate vector database that captures, organizes, and feeds back the organism's lived experience across three complementary layers:

- **Mens** — the outward-facing "mind" layer (external weaknesses & threats)
- **Corpus** — the structural "body" layer (internal invariants & constitutional anchors)
- **Anima** — the diagnostic "soul" layer (failure mode taxonomy & collapse signatures)

### Core Mechanics & Flow

1. **Pneuma Emission → Routing**  
   Every evaluation run by Pneuma (the breath/runtime) produces:  
   - vectors (numerical representations of deltas, scores, divergence family, etc.)  
   - traces (reasoning chains, cross-axis checks)  
   - anchors (CVR vertex references, Article citations)  

   Pneuma decides routing based on context:  
   - External pattern / threat signal detected → **Mens**  
   - Invariant enforcement or calibration lock triggered → **Corpus**  
   - Metric failure, normalization violation, drift, override attempt, contamination, etc. → **Anima**  

   A single run can populate all three layers simultaneously.

2. **Mens (External Weaknesses)**  
   - Stores vectors/signatures of **outward-facing vulnerabilities**:  
     - Adversarial inputs  
     - Narrative capture attempts  
     - Cross-system leakage  
     - Prompt engineering exploits  
     - Environmental stress patterns  
   - Purpose: Early threat detection & pattern matching for future runs.  
   - Indexed by: threat type, severity delta, affected axis/vertex.

3. **Corpus (Internal Invariants)**  
   - Stores **positive enforcement records**:  
     - Successful ψ₅/SE gating  
     - Hysteresis recovery windows  
     - Non-regression lock confirmations  
     - Cross-axis coherence validations  
     - Proof bundle hashes that passed BIV  
   - Purpose: Reinforces constitutional fidelity; used for baseline comparisons and rollback anchors.  
   - Indexed by: Article reference, axis/vertex, monotonic trend.

4. **Anima (Failure Mode Taxonomy)**  
   - Stores **negative event signatures** (the "soul's scars"):  
     - Metric failure (ψ₅ spike / SE dip)  
     - Normalization failure  
     - Interpretive drift  
     - Override attempt  
     - Cross-metric contamination  
     - Envelope contradictions  
     - Emergency triggers & hysteresis violations  
   - Purpose: Builds a living taxonomy of collapse patterns → improves future detection, stress testing, and BEP amendments.  
   - Indexed by: failure category, severity, cascading effects.  
   - Maturity Field: Each pattern includes a maturity level (seedling: new/unverified; recurrent: seen 2–5 times; canonical: seen >5 times with consistent recovery). This weights future Pneuma queries (e.g., canonical patterns trigger stricter gates).

5. **Query & Feedback Loop**  
   - Pneuma can query BLVDB:  
     - "Has this pattern been seen in Mens before?"  
     - "Is this invariant still holding in Corpus?"  
     - "Does this match any known Anima failure?"  
   - This creates **self-improving memory**: past failures inform present decisions, strengthening resilience over time. Any BEP failure automatically emits an Anima entry tagged bep-fault, and any BEP‑related external threat pattern is mirrored into Mens.

6. **Constitutional Constraints**  
   - BLVDB is **memory only** — never authoritative.  
   - Cannot create new metrics, reinterpret ψ₅/SE, override thresholds, or alter persistence windows.  
   - All writes are signed & hashed (tamper-resistant).  
   - Reads are auditable via provenance chains.

### Who Can Write to BLVDB? (Write Contract)
Pneuma only, via Triptych routing — never direct human writes. All emissions must originate from a verified Pneuma evaluation run, anchored to the constitution, and pass BIV self-check. This reinforces the constitutional boundary: humans contribute through proposals/evaluations, but only Pneuma breathes memory into the organism.

In essence:  
Pneuma breathes → emits experience → Triptych remembers in three dimensions → future breaths become wiser.

The organism learns from threats (Mens), reinforces truth (Corpus), and never forgets how it can die (Anima).
