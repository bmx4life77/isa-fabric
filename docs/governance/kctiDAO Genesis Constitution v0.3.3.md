# **Genesis Governance v4.0**  
### *A Constitutional Framework for Coherent, Safe, and Self‑Correcting Governance*  
**This document is constitutionally frozen at Genesis Governance v4.0.0.

# **Article 0 — Metric Authority Doctrine**  
### *(Operative)*

**Purpose:** Define which metrics may influence execution state.

- **ψ₅ (Security Posture, Pillar V)** — authoritative, enforceable  
- **SE (System Efficiency)** — authoritative, enforceable, sole composite metric permitted to influence execution state  
- **All other metrics** — including Θ, β, ι, φ, VU, RSI, drift, divergence, coherence — are **strictly descriptive**

**Canonical Statement:**  
**Only designated authoritative metrics may influence execution state.**

This doctrine prevents metric creep, dashboard tyranny, post‑hoc justification, and governance drift.

# **Article I — Preamble (Principles Only)**  
### *(Operative)*

Genesis Governance v4.0 establishes a constitutional framework for governing complex systems under uncertainty.  
It is designed not for preference aggregation, but for **maintaining coherence, safety, and integrity over time**.

It proceeds from the recognition that:

- complex systems fail non‑linearly  
- authority degrades when unbounded  
- governance must detect and correct its own instability  

Accordingly, Genesis Governance is founded on the following principles:

### **Principle I — State Precedes Process**  
Governance authority arises from system state, not from procedure alone.

### **Principle II — Safety Is Non‑Negotiable**  
Security and systemic integrity take precedence over throughput or convenience.

### **Principle III — Authority Must Be Bounded**  
No role, process, or narrative may override constitutional limits.

### **Principle IV — Metrics Must Be Separated by Authority**  
Only authoritative metrics may influence execution state.

### **Principle V — Governance Must Be Self‑Correcting**  
Governance must observe outcomes and recalibrate deliberately.

### **Principle VI — Evolution Without Drift**  
Change must preserve core invariants and resist erosion of authority boundaries.

### **Principle VII — Clarity Follows Resilience**  
Legibility increases only as robustness increases.

**This Preamble establishes intent and posture only.  
It does not grant authority or modify execution conditions.**

---

# **Article II — Proposal Lifecycle**  
### *(Operative)*

**Purpose:** Define how governance intent transitions system state.

---

## **II.0 Canonical State Prerequisite**

- Impact Profiles are the **canonical state representation** of participants  
- Roles, permissions, thresholds, proposal rights, and emergency authorities are **derived views**, not independent objects  
- No parallel or shadow state is permitted  
- Cached state must be provably recomputable and non‑authoritative  

---

## **II.1 Proposal Creation**

- Eligibility derived from Impact Profiles  
- Canonical state snapshot required  

---

## **II.2 Proposal Validation**

- Structural correctness  
- Canonical alignment  
- Threshold and domain validation  

---

## **II.3 Deliberation Phase**

- Informational only  
- Θ‑layer and narrative allowed but **strictly non‑authoritative**  

---

## **II.4 Voting Phase**

- Voting power derived from Impact Profiles  
- Snapshot‑anchored for traceability  

---

## **II.5 Execution Phase**

- Timelock scheduling  
- Canonical state revalidation  
- ψ₅ and SE influence execution state  
- Emergency protocol checks  

**Execution is a state transition, not a procedural action.**

**Material change definition:**  
A material change is any Impact Profile modification that alters **eligibility, voting weight, domain authority, or emergency classification**.

---

## **II.6 Post‑Execution Review**

- Impact Profiles updated  
- GCS adjudicates stability  
- Calibration recommendations generated  

---

# **Article III — Closed‑Loop Governance Architecture**  
### *(Descriptive, Non‑Operative)*

**Purpose:** Describe the system‑level control architecture.

---

## **III.1 The Governance Loop**

- Governance defines intent  
- Metrics observe reality  
- GCS adjudicates stability  
- Emergency protocols intervene  
- Calibration adjusts thresholds  
- Governance learns and updates intent  

---

## **III.2 Significance**

Genesis Governance operates as a **closed‑loop cybernetic system**, comparable to aviation safety and distributed systems resilience.

---

## **III.3 Constitutional Alignment**

Consistent with:

- ψ₅ as structural truth  
- SE as operational truth  
- Θ as temporal revelation  
- Impact Profiles as canonical participant state  
- GCS as adjudication layer  

**Clarifying Clause:**  
*This article describes system architecture and does not itself grant authority or modify execution conditions.*

---

# **Article IV — Emergency and Intervention Protocols**  
### *(Operative)*

Defines:

- emergency classification thresholds  
- intervention scope  
- authority constraints  
- recovery and rollback procedures  

Emergency authority is bounded and subordinate to Article 0.

---

# **Article V — Calibration, Evolution, and Governance Learning**  
### *(Operative — Updated)*

**Purpose:** Define how governance adapts without drifting.

---

## **V.1 Calibration Mechanisms**

Calibration may adjust:

- parameters  
- thresholds  
- weights  
- timing windows  
- domain‑specific sensitivities  

All calibration actions must be:

- explicit  
- logged  
- auditable  
- derived from canonical state  
- subordinate to Article 0  

---

## **V.2 Learning Feedback Loops**

Governance must observe outcomes and adjust parameters deliberately, using:

- post‑execution reviews  
- stability adjudication from GCS  
- historical performance  
- incident analysis  

Learning is a maintenance function, not a legislative one.

---

## **V.3 Evolution Constraints**

Evolution must preserve:

- constitutional invariants  
- authority boundaries  
- canonical state integrity  
- safety precedence  
- the Metric Authority Doctrine  

**Calibration may adjust parameters and thresholds but may not redefine constitutional authority or introduce new forms of influence over execution state.**

This clause prevents:

- authority expansion through parameter tuning  
- silent introduction of new execution‑state modifiers  
- reinterpretation of thresholds as new forms of power  
- bypassing Article 0 through “calibration”  

---

## **V.4 Versioning and Change Control**

All governance upgrades must:

- reference canonical state  
- affirm Appendix A invariants  
- undergo validation and deliberation  
- avoid silent drift  
- maintain backward coherence  

Evolution is permitted only when it preserves the constitutional posture established in Articles 0–IV.
