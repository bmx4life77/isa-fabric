Foundational Governance Architecture for ISA Fabric

Genesis Governance is the constitutional substrate of ISA Fabric — a principled, resilient, and future‑proof governance system designed to survive success, contributors, forks, and time. It defines the roles, processes, invariants, and interpretive layers that guide how ISA Fabric evolves while preserving safety, clarity, and contributor dignity.

This repository contains the Genesis Governance Constitution (v4.0), supporting artifacts, calibration references, and interpretive layers such as Θ (Theta), the Meta‑Lens, and the RASUV‑aligned benchmarking framework.

Genesis Governance is not a policy document.  
It is a structural architecture — a blueprint for safe evolution.

🌐 Purpose

Genesis Governance provides:

- A minimal, principled constitutional core  
- A clear separation between operative law and descriptive architecture  
- A lens‑based interpretive system (Θ, Meta‑Lens, RASUV)  
- A proposal lifecycle that is predictable and auditable  
- A failure‑mode‑aware governance model  
- A future‑proof structure that can scale with contributors, domains, and forks  

It is intentionally designed to be:

- lightweight  
- non‑bureaucratic  
- metrics‑aware  
- resilient under stress  
- transparent and self‑documenting

This structure cleanly separates:

- Operative law (Constitution)  
- Descriptive architecture (non‑binding)  
- Interpretive layers (Θ, Meta‑Lens, RASUV)  
- Calibration and thresholds  
- Emergency and fail‑safe logic

🧩 Core Concepts

1. Operative Articles (Constitution v4.0)
The Constitution defines:

- Roles & responsibilities  
- Proposal lifecycle  
- Activation & deactivation rules  
- Thresholds & quorum logic  
- Emergency powers  
- Stewardship and contributor rights  
- Versioning and lineage  

These articles are frozen, except through the formal amendment process.

---

2. Descriptive Architecture
Non‑normative documents that:

- explain the system  
- provide diagrams  
- describe invariants  
- outline failure modes  
- give examples and rationale  

These documents cannot override the Constitution.

---

3. Θ (Theta) Operator — Interpretive Lens
Θ is a read‑only interpretive operator that:

- clarifies ambiguous proposals  
- resolves semantic drift  
- ensures alignment with invariants  
- provides a structured interpretive layer  

Θ does not create new authority.  
It is a lens, not a power.

---

4. Lens‑Class Operators (Optional Article)
Inspired by Θ, Lens‑Class Operators provide:

- domain‑specific interpretive layers  
- structured semantic guidance  
- non‑binding advisory clarity  

These operators are optional and non‑authoritative, ensuring the Constitution remains simple and unfragmented.

---

5. RASUV Meta‑Lens
A metrics‑aligned interpretive layer that uses:

- Rate  
- Amplitude  
- Spread  
- Uniformity  
- Variance  

RASUV is used for:

- governance calibration  
- threshold validation  
- failure‑mode detection  
- proposal impact profiling  

---

🔄 Proposal Lifecycle

Genesis Governance defines a predictable, auditable lifecycle:

1. Draft  
2. Lens Review (Θ + Meta‑Lens)  
3. Impact Profile Assignment  
4. Threshold Evaluation  
5. Voting Window  
6. Activation / Rejection  
7. Lineage Recording  

Every step is:

- documented  
- reproducible  
- metrics‑aware  
- steward‑friendly  

---

🛡 Thresholds & Calibration

Thresholds are defined using:

- BFT‑style safety bounds  
- collusion thresholds  
- risk envelopes  
- RASUV‑aligned calibration  

Examples:

- <33% Byzantine Fault Tolerance  
- ≥40% collusion risk threshold  
- ψ₅‑aligned anomaly ceilings  
- divergence‑based emergency triggers  

These thresholds are frozen invariants unless amended.

---

🚨 Emergency Protocols

Emergency procedures are:

- minimal  
- clearly scoped  
- time‑bounded  
- metrics‑aware  
- steward‑controlled  

They include:

- anomaly triggers  
- divergence ceilings  
- rollback windows  
- temporary authority elevation  
- automatic de‑escalation  

---

🧠 Failure Mode Test Vectors

Genesis Governance includes a library of failure mode vectors used for:

- stress testing  
- calibration  
- proposal evaluation  
- governance drift detection  

Examples include:

- Enron collapse  
- Terra UST collapse  
- adversarial governance scenarios  
- collusion and quorum manipulation  
- semantic drift and proposal ambiguity  

These vectors help ensure the Constitution is resilient under real‑world stress.

🧪 Integration with ISA Fabric

Genesis Governance is the governance substrate for ISA Fabric.

It integrates with:

- ISA Metrics  
- NatSpec++  
- RASUV  
- Calibration envelopes  
- Domain packs  
- CLI governance tools  

The governance system is metrics‑aware, but metrics never override constitutional authority.
