# ⭐ **ISA FABRIC CONSTITUTION — VERSION 5.1**  


### *Metric‑Constitutional Governance for Multi‑Agent, Drift‑Resistant Systems*


# **PREAMBLE**

This Constitution establishes the immutable governance architecture of the ISA Fabric.  
It defines the exclusive authority sources, evaluator protections, constitutional invariants, and non‑regression guarantees that govern all agents, processes, forks, and derivative systems operating under or inheriting from the ISA Fabric.

The purpose of this Constitution is to ensure:

- clarity of authority  
- resilience under adversarial pressure  
- immunity to narrative capture  
- monotonic improvement  
- drift detection and prediction  
- constitutional integrity across forks  
- verifiable governance actions  
- safety, stability, and coherence across all governance surfaces  

This Constitution is **frozen at version 5.1**.  
Any modification MUST proceed under Article V and SHALL preserve all constitutional invariants.
