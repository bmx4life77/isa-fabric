# ISA Fabric Documentation

Welcome to the ISA Fabric documentation system. This folder contains all reference materials for the ecosystem, including governance, metrics, CLI usage, domain packs, and contributor guides.

This documentation is intentionally structured for long-term growth. Some sections are still under construction as the Benchmarking Engine, Domain Packs, and CLI implementations continue to evolve.

## Structure

- **governance/** — Governance architecture, Constitution, thresholds, calibration, emergency protocols.
- **cli/** — CLI tutorials, workflows, and command references.
- **metrics/** — ISA Metrics definitions, benchmarking engine, calibration engine, RASUV.
- **domain-packs/** — Domain-specific profiles, envelopes, models, and artifacts.
- **contributing/** — Contributor onboarding, proposal templates, NatSpec++ guides.
- **glossary.md** — Full glossary of ISA Metrics, NatSpec++, and governance terms.

More content will be added as the system matures.
