# 📘 ISA Fabric Documentation Hub  
### *Overview & Navigation Guide*

Welcome to the **central documentation hub** for ISA Fabric — the unified reference for the entire ecosystem, including:

- NatSpec++ semantic framework  
- ISA Metrics & benchmarking lattice  
- Governance Benchmarking Standard & Genesis Governance v4.0  
- Spec Compliance Engine (SCE)  
- CLI tooling  
- Canonical artifacts  
- Datasets, simulations, and research outputs  

This hub is deliberately layered to mirror the architecture itself:

- **Interface Layer** — CLI, developer tools, quick-start guides  
- **Governance Layer** — constitutional documents, standards, lattice  
- **Research Layer** — benchmarks, datasets, stress testing, analysis  
- **Architecture Layer** — system design, flows, conceptual models  

Use this page as your **starting compass**. Every major subsystem has a dedicated home.

## ⚡ 1. CLI Documentation (`docs/cli/`)

Everything related to the **ISA Fabric CLI** — the primary way most contributors interact with the system.

**What you'll find:**
- CLI README (command tree, examples, global flags)
- Full command group reference (governance, benchmark, tags, etc.)
- Contribution guidelines for CLI development
- ASCII architecture diagrams
- Extension patterns (adding new commands/groups)

**Start here if you want to:**
- Use or extend the CLI
- Run governance evaluations, benchmarks, or NatSpec++ parsing

## 🏛️ 2. Governance Documentation (`docs/governance/`)

The governance subsystem is the intellectual and constitutional core of ISA Fabric.

### a. Standard (`docs/governance/standard/`)
Normative specifications — formal, versioned, and referenceable.

- Governance Benchmarking Standard v1.0  
- Governance Benchmarking Lattice v1.0 (10 axes, ~60 vertices)  
- Stress Testing Framework v1.0  
- Vertex-level scoring methodology  
- Benchmark output format & reporting guidelines  

**Use this when you need the canonical rules for benchmarking any governance model.**

### b. Cornerstone (`docs/governance/cornerstone/`)
Philosophical and constitutional foundation — the "why" behind the system.

- Foundational Rationale & Metric Authority Doctrine  
- Constitutional Supremacy & Interpretive Firewall  
- Calibration Non-Regression Protocol  
- Authority Purity & Drift Prevention Principles  

**Start here if you're studying the governance philosophy or constitutional design.**

### c. Research Lab (`docs/governance/research-lab/`)
Empirical and analytical outputs — where governance becomes measurable.

- Machine-readable lattice datasets  
- Comparative benchmarks (Genesis v4.0 vs. Bitcoin, Tezos, Ethereum, etc.)  
- Stressed lattice results & resilience envelopes  
- Failure-mode mappings & case studies  
- Annual adversarial test results (planned)

**Go here for data-driven governance research and cross-model comparisons.**

## 🧬 3. Architecture Documentation (`docs/architecture/`)

High-level and subsystem-level design overviews.

**What you'll find:**
- ISA Fabric conceptual model & layered architecture  
- Governance engine flow diagrams (ASCII & future SVG)  
- CLI internal architecture  
- Canonical artifact pipeline  
- Dataset generation & simulation overview  

**Start here if you're integrating, extending the core engine, or need to understand how components connect.**

## 🎯 How to Navigate the Documentation

| Your Goal                              | Start Here                                      | Recommended Path                                      |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Use the CLI quickly                    | `docs/cli/`                                     | CLI README → command examples → `isa --help`          |
| Understand governance philosophy       | `docs/governance/cornerstone/`                  | Metric Authority Doctrine → Interpretive Firewall     |
| Benchmark a governance model           | `docs/governance/standard/`                     | Lattice v1.0 → Scoring Methodology → Stress Tests     |
| Run empirical comparisons              | `docs/governance/research-lab/`                 | Comparative benchmarks → Stressed lattice results     |
| Extend or integrate the system         | `docs/architecture/`                            | Conceptual model → Governance engine flow → CLI arch  |
| Contribute to CLI or governance        | `docs/cli/` + `docs/governance/standard/`       | Contribution guidelines → lattice extension rules     |

## 🔄 Keeping This Hub Alive

- All documentation is **versioned** and **immutable** once published (aligned with Genesis Governance principles)  
- Updates follow semantic versioning (v0.x → breaking changes, v1.0+ → stable)  
- Pull requests welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)  
- Issues & discussions: [github.com/bmx4life77/isa-fabric](https://github.com/bmx4life77/isa-fabric)

This hub is intentionally **minimal, focused, and layered** — just like the system it documents.

If you ever feel lost, return here.  
This is your compass.
