# ISA Fabric — Schema Definitions

This folder contains the machine-readable schemas that define the structural, semantic, and validation rules for ISA Fabric components. These schemas form the standards layer of the ecosystem and are used by engines, validators, linters, and contributors to ensure consistency across implementations.

Schemas in this directory include:

- ISA Metrics profiles and weighting definitions  
- Domain‑pack configuration schemas  
- Telemetry and envelope schemas  
- Macro‑state and modulation schemas  
- Expectations and derivation schemas  
- Validation rules for NatSpec++ and related standards  

All schemas in this directory are versioned and included in Zenodo releases.
