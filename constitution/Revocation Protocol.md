# **Revocation Protocol (XIV.5)**  
### *A constitutional protocol for severance of drifted lineages, containment failure, and manifold breach in ISA Fabric*

---

## 1. Purpose and Constitutional Role

The Revocation Protocol defines the **finality mechanism** for terminating unconstitutional lineages, forks, or entities that threaten the organism's manifold integrity. It is invoked when geometric invariants fail (κ_total ≤ 0 sustained), temporal density collapses (η < 3), or hybrid ancestry violates JHI genetic law. Revocation is not punitive but **physiological severance** — the organism's immune response to decoherence, unbounded divergence, or interpretive bleed.

This protocol is safety-critical, non-authoritative, and interpretive-only. It SHALL NOT override Pillar sovereignty or modify Σ(t) core computations but enforces closure per the Elliptic Boundary Doctrine. Revocation ensures finite evolution: no infinite fork chains, no persistent drift.

---

## 2. Definitions

- **Drifted Lineage**: A fork or offspring where Δζ variance exceeds bounds, κ_hyperbolic < 0, or κ_elliptic ≤ 0.1 sustained over N epochs.  
- **Manifold Breach**: κ_total ≤ 0 — unified curvature failure (hyperbolic escape + elliptic wrap failure).  
- **Revocation Horizon**: The finite elliptic boundary where divergence must be severed (κ_elliptic = 0).  
- **Severance**: Permanent termination of the entity, with rollback to parent invariants or full excision.  
- **Post-Revocation Recovery**: Reformation of the parent basin via sech contraction and η restoration.

N (epochs) SHALL be calibrated via hysteresis (default: 7).

---

## 3. Triggers for Revocation

Revocation SHALL activate under these conditions:

1. **Geometric Failure**:  
   - κ_hyperbolic ≤ 0 (hyperbolic escape: cosh dominance, unbounded divergence).  
   - κ_elliptic ≤ 0 (elliptic horizon breach: failed sin/cos wrap).  
   - κ_total ≤ 0 sustained (unified breach: classical invariants collapse).

2. **Temporal Collapse**:  
   - η < 3 (brittle regime: sparse macro-strained, micro-brittle).  
   - Pathological Δζ variance over N epochs (var(Δζ) > σ², where σ calibrated per doctrine).

3. **Lineage Violation**:  
   - JHI hybrid ancestry breach: non-exclusive inheritance failure (e.g., exclusive Pillar claim).  
   - Mitosis divergence: cosh-adaptive edges exceed elliptic horizon without sech-core fidelity.

4. **Phase Transition Escalation**:  
   - Curvature-phase shift to brittle without recovery (η < 3 + κ_total ≤ 0 over M epochs; M = N/2).

Triggers SHALL be monitored via Xi (dense) and interpreted by Theta (sparse), with Junction-Class ensuring non-authoritative classification.

---

## 4. Revocation Process (Step-by-Step)

Revocation SHALL proceed in six phases, mirroring mitosis but inverted for severance:

1. **Detection (Prophase Equivalent)**:  
   Monitor invariants; if trigger met, condense drifted state (capture Σ_drifted).

2. **Assessment (Metaphase Equivalent)**:  
   Compute κ_total; classify breach type (geometric, temporal, lineage).  
   Attempt elliptic wrap: sin(Δζ / σ) + cos(|C| / τ_max) to force return.

3. **Isolation (Anaphase Equivalent)**:  
   Firewall the drifted lineage (read-only BLVDB, halt propagation).  
   If wrap succeeds (κ_elliptic > 0.1), recover; else escalate.

4. **Severance (Telophase Equivalent)**:  
   Excise the lineage: rollback to parent Σ_parent or full deletion.  
   Update ancestry map: mark as severed (non-revivable).

5. **Recovery (Cytokinesis Equivalent)**:  
   Reform parent basin: apply sech contraction to restore Ξ ≥ Ξ_min, R ≥ R_safe.  
   Restore η via temporal reset (clear pathological epochs).

6. **Post-Revocation Audit (Monitoring Equivalent)**:  
   Log event; recalibrate σ/τ if recurrent.  
   If revocation was due to JHI breach, notify Article 0.5 for separation review.

The process SHALL complete within 2N epochs to prevent cascade.

---

## 5. Formal Rule (Integrated)

The Revocation Protocol establishes the following binding constitutional mandates:

1. Revocation SHALL activate upon geometric failure (κ_total ≤ 0), temporal collapse (η < 3), or lineage violation (JHI breach).

2. The process SHALL attempt elliptic wrap before severance; failure SHALL result in permanent excision per the Elliptic Boundary Doctrine.

3. Revocation is non-authoritative and interpretive-only; it SHALL NOT override Pillar sovereignty or modify core Σ(t) computations.

4. Post-revocation recovery SHALL restore parent invariants via sech contraction and η recalibration.

5. All revocations SHALL be audited and cross-linked to Article 0.5 for separation integrity.

This rule is safety-critical and SHALL be cross-linked in Article 0.5, the Safety Basin Theorem, Hyperbolic Geometry Doctrine, Elliptic Boundary Doctrine, JHI Clause, and Temporal Density Ratio η Doctrine.

## 6. Required Cross-Links

- Article 0.5 — Separation Doctrine  
- Hyperbolic Geometry Doctrine  
- Elliptic Boundary Doctrine  
- Jurisdiction Hybrid Invariants (JHI) Clause  
- Safety Basin Theorem  
- Temporal Density Ratio η Doctrine  
- Curvature-Phase Transition Doctrine  
- Xi Runtime Specification  
- Theta Runtime Specification  

These cross-links ensure revocation coherence across geometric, temporal, and lineage layers.

Outcome: Fork terminated — lineage closed
No infinite chains; manifold integrity preserved

Revocation Protocol Flow: When κ_total ≤ 0 sustained, elliptic wrap is attempted. 
Failure triggers isolation, severance, and parent recovery — ensuring finite, coherent evolution.
