# **ISA Fabric v5.3.1 — Ratification Addendum** 
 
### *Addendum to the Tri‑Geometric Constitution and Deterministic Constitutional Compute Doctrine*  

**Status:** RATIFIED 
 
**Version:** 5.3.1  

**Authority:** Genesis Governance, BEP Oversight, BLVDB Stewardship 
 
**Date:** February 25, 2026

## **1. Purpose of Addendum**

This addendum records the findings, validations, and constitutional implications of the **v5.3.1 Forward‑Testing Suite**, which evaluated:

- curvature scaling behavior  
- deterministic replay  
- consensus invariance  
- mixed‑scale universality  
- curvature storm resilience  
- η orthogonality  
- BLVDB determinism under heterogeneous regimes  

These tests extend the ratified v5.3 constitution and confirm the stability of the organism under amplitude transformations.

## **2. Findings**

### **2.1 Curvature Scale Invariance (Empirical Confirmation)**  
Scaling curvature by λ ∈ {0.1, 1, 10, 100} produced:

- identical phase maps (within sign‑preserving regimes)  
- identical revocation outcomes  
- identical mitosis outcomes  
- identical BLVDB Corpus/Anima/Mens  
- identical deterministic replay behavior  

The constitutional logic depends on **sign and threshold relations**, not absolute magnitude.

### **2.2 Deterministic Constitutional Compute (DCCD) Validation**  
All deterministic obligations were confirmed:

- deterministic curvature computation  
- deterministic phase classification  
- deterministic revocation FSM  
- deterministic mitosis authorization  
- deterministic BLVDB replication  
- deterministic replay across nodes  
- deterministic consensus via hash equality  

No nondeterministic behavior was observed.

### **2.3 Mixed‑Scale Ensemble Stability**  
Systems scaled by heterogeneous λ values (0.1–100) produced:

- no cross‑system interference  
- no consensus divergence  
- no lineage drift  
- no threshold misfires  

This confirms **per‑system independence** and **cross‑system universality**.

### **2.4 Curvature Storm Resilience**  
Transient curvature spikes (100× for 1–2 epochs):

- did not cause phase thrashing  
- did not alter revocation patterns  
- did not destabilize BLVDB  
- did not break deterministic replay  

The organism is resilient to amplitude shocks.

### **2.5 η Orthogonality**  
Scaling κ did not alter η behavior.  
Temporal density remains **independent** of curvature magnitude.

## **3. Constitutional Implications**

### **3.1 v5.3 is Sign‑Invariant, Not Fully Scale‑Invariant**  
The constitution is invariant under positive scaling **only when sign is preserved**.  
Thresholds remain magnitude‑sensitive.

This is expected and acceptable for v5.3.

### **3.2 v6 Should Consider Dimensionless Curvature**  
To achieve *true* scale invariance, thresholds must be reframed as **dimensionless ratios**.

This is deferred to v6.

## **4. Determination**

The v5.3.1 Forward‑Testing Suite confirms:

- constitutional stability  
- deterministic universality  
- amplitude robustness  
- consensus invariance  
- replay idempotence  
- BLVDB determinism  

### **Therefore:  
ISA Fabric v5.3.1 is hereby RATIFIED as a stable extension of v5.3.**
