The **Metric Authority Doctrine** is the foundational, operative constitutional rule in **Genesis Governance v4.0** (the binding governance framework for ISA Fabric and related systems). It is explicitly defined in **Article 0** of the document and serves as the supreme, non-negotiable safeguard against **metric creep**, **dashboard tyranny**, **post-hoc justification**, and **governance drift**.

### Canonical Statement (Direct from Article 0)
> **Only designated authoritative metrics may influence execution state.**

This single sentence is the doctrine's core. It constitutionally restricts which signals can affect binding system actions (e.g., proposal execution, timelocks, emergency interventions, or material state changes). All other metrics are barred from having any such influence.

### Authoritative vs. Descriptive Metrics (Explicit Classification)
The doctrine clearly delineates two categories:

- **Authoritative / Enforceable Metrics** (the only ones permitted to influence execution state):
  - **ψ₅** (Security Posture, Pillar V) — authoritative, enforceable.  
    This is the synthesized structural integrity composite (from the RASUV decomposition: Reentrancy, Access, State, Upgrade, Verification).
  - **SE** (System Efficiency) — authoritative, enforceable, and the **sole composite metric** allowed to influence execution state.  
    (Operational efficiency / structural exposure; primary form SE = 1 - normalized latency or throughput/capacity; variant SEₛ from ψ₁+ψ₂+ψ₃.)

- **All Other Metrics** — **strictly descriptive** (advisory, observational, or interpretive only; **never** gates, triggers, thresholds, or execution influencers):
  - Θ (Theta-family operators and regimes)
  - β (systemic risk/throughput)
  - ι (momentum)
  - φ (capital/recovery efficiency)
  - VU (volatility)
  - RSI, drift, divergence, coherence, and any other derived or raw signals
  - Narratives, dashboards, or post-hoc rationales

**Direct Quote** (from Article 0):
> "**ψ₅ (Security Posture, Pillar V)** — authoritative, enforceable  
> **SE (System Efficiency)** — authoritative, enforceable, sole composite metric permitted to influence execution state  
> **All other metrics** — including Θ, β, ι, φ, VU, RSI, drift, divergence, coherence — are **strictly descriptive**"

### Purpose & Rationale (Explicitly Stated)
The doctrine exists to eliminate common governance failure modes:
- **Metric creep** — proliferation of signals gradually gaining de-facto power.
- **Dashboard tyranny** — over-reliance on visual/narrative metrics overriding invariants.
- **Post-hoc justification** — using descriptive signals to rationalize unsafe or drift-inducing actions.
- **Governance drift** — silent expansion of authority through calibration or reinterpretation.

**Direct Quote** (from Article 0):
> "This doctrine prevents metric creep, dashboard tyranny, post‑hoc justification, and governance drift."

### Enforcement Across the Governance Lifecycle
- **Proposal & Execution** (Article II): Execution revalidation and gating keyed only to ψ₅/SE.
- **Deliberation Phase** (Article II.3): Θ-regimes and narratives allowed but **strictly non-authoritative**.
- **Calibration & Evolution** (Article V): Adjustments to parameters/thresholds are subordinate; cannot redefine what is authoritative or introduce new execution influencers.
- **Emergency Protocols** (Article IV): Bounded interventions checked against ψ₅/SE deterioration.
- **Θ Integration** (cross-referenced via Theta Promotion Charter): Θ-regimes are lenses (L0/L1 max) — explicitly barred from authority to align with the doctrine.
- **Invariants Checklist** (Appendix A — frozen): Auditable list preserving SE as sole composite and ψ₅ as pillar truth.

### Implications & Philosophical Posture
- **Safety Precedence** (Principle II): Structural integrity (ψ₅) and efficiency (SE) always override convenience or narrative.
- **Authority Bounding** (Principle III): No role/process/narrative overrides constitutional limits.
- **Self-Correcting** (Principle V): Governance observes outcomes via authoritative metrics only.
- **Ethical Humility**: Prevents "authority escalation through parameter tuning" or "silent introduction of new execution-state modifiers" (Article V.3).

In one sentence:  
The Metric Authority Doctrine is the supreme constitutional rule in Genesis Governance v4.0 that restricts execution-state influence exclusively to ψ₅ (structural integrity) and SE (operational efficiency), rendering every other metric strictly descriptive and thereby safeguarding the system against drift, capture, tyranny of dashboards, and ethical overreach across indefinite time horizons.

This doctrine is the "constitutional heartbeat" that ensures ISA Fabric remains coherent, safe, and self-correcting — even under stress or adversarial conditions.
