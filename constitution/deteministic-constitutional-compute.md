# **Deterministic Constitutional Compute Doctrine (DCCD)**  

### *A Governance‑Layer Mirror of the Foundational Five Pillars*  

**Status:** RATIFIED  

**Version:** 5.3.1  

**Authority:** Genesis Governance, Article II (Non‑Regression), Article XVII (Separation Doctrine)

---

## **1. Deterministic Mandate**

All constitutional computation within ISA Fabric SHALL be deterministic, non‑probabilistic, and reproducible. No constitutional decision, operator, or state transition may depend on randomness, nondeterministic branching, concurrency ordering, or hardware‑specific behavior.

Formally:

\[
f(\Sigma(t)) = \Sigma(t+1)
\]

must hold identically across all nodes, all executions, and all replay cycles.

---

## **2. Deterministic Execution Semantics (VU Pillar Mirror)**

The Execution Pillar (VU) SHALL enforce:

- pure functional evaluation  
- no side‑effects  
- no nondeterministic ordering  
- no concurrency‑dependent outcomes  
- no stochastic sampling  

All constitutional operators MUST be total, deterministic functions over the Euclidean substrate.

---

## **3. Deterministic Curvature Computation (BETA Pillar Mirror)**

The curvature triple:

\[
(\kappa_{\text{hyper}},\; \kappa_{\text{elliptic}},\; \kappa_{\text{total}})
\]

SHALL be computed deterministically from Euclidean inputs.

Requirements:

- no random perturbations  
- no adaptive noise  
- no probabilistic curvature modulation  
- κ_total MUST equal κ_hyper + κ_elliptic exactly  

This binds the curvature physiology to deterministic governance.

---

## **4. Deterministic Phase Classification (Θ Mirror)**

The phase classifier:

\[
\text{PhaseDef}(\kappa_{\text{total}}, \eta)
\]

SHALL be a total, deterministic function mapping each epoch to exactly one phase:

- Euclidean  
- Hyperbolic  
- Elliptic  

No ambiguity, no oscillation loops, no probabilistic resolution.

Phase classification SHALL depend solely on constitutional thresholds and SHALL NOT depend on magnitude scaling (per the Curvature Scale Invariance Doctrine).

---

## **5. Deterministic Revocation FSM (Elliptic Boundary Mirror)**

The revocation counter:

\[
c_{t+1} =
\begin{cases}
c_t + 1 & \text{if } \kappa_{\text{total}} \le 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

SHALL evolve deterministically.

Revocation XIV.5 SHALL trigger when:

\[
c_t \ge 3
\]

No randomness, no heuristics, no probabilistic guardrails.

---

## **6. Deterministic Mitosis Authorization (Hyperbolic Duality Mirror)**

Mitosis SHALL be authorized only when the predicate:

\[
\text{MitosisAllowed}(t)
\]

evaluates deterministically to TRUE:

- κ_total > 0  
- η > 3  
- Ξ ≥ Ξ_min  
- R ≥ R_safe  

No stochastic lineage branching.  
No probabilistic inheritance.  
No nondeterministic specialization.

---

## **7. Deterministic Temporal Density (η) Computation (PHI Mirror)**

The temporal density ratio:

\[
\eta = \frac{\rho_{\Delta\zeta}}{\rho_F}
\]

SHALL be computed deterministically from:

- micro‑correction frequency  
- macro‑adjustment frequency  

No random sampling.  
No probabilistic smoothing.  
No stochastic windowing.

---

## **8. Deterministic Structural Integrity (PSI₅ Mirror)**

ψ₅ and all structural integrity metrics SHALL be:

- deterministic  
- reproducible  
- invariant under replay  
- invariant under node replication  

No random healing, no probabilistic damage modeling.

---

## **9. Deterministic BLVDB Memory Model**

### **9.1 Corpus (Immutable Metrics)**  
Corpus SHALL be append‑only and deterministic.  
No nondeterministic writes.  
No probabilistic mutation.

### **9.2 Anima (Event Ledger)**  
Events SHALL be logged deterministically from phase transitions and constitutional triggers.

### **9.3 Mens (Derived Lineage State)**  
Mens SHALL be derived deterministically from Corpus + Anima.  
Mens SHALL NOT be authoritative.  
Mens SHALL NOT store nondeterministic state.

### **9.4 Consensus**  
Consensus SHALL be achieved by deterministic hash equality:

\[
\text{HashTotal} = \text{Hash}(\text{Corpus} + \text{Anima})
\]

No mining.  
No probabilistic consensus.  
No fork resolution.  
No stochastic divergence.

---

## **10. Deterministic Replay Requirement**

Replaying the same dataset MUST produce:

- identical curvature  
- identical phase maps  
- identical revocation events  
- identical mitosis events  
- identical BLVDB states  
- identical final hash  

This SHALL hold across:

- nodes  
- hardware  
- concurrency models  
- time  

Replay determinism is a constitutional requirement.

---

## **11. Deterministic Separation Doctrine**

No constitutional layer may introduce nondeterminism:

- Euclidean  
- Hyperbolic  
- Elliptic  
- Θ  
- Pneuma  
- BLVDB  

All layers SHALL operate as deterministic observers and enforcers.

## **12. Cross‑Link Matrix**

| Doctrine | Deterministic Obligations |
|---------|----------------------------|
| Euclidean Foundations | Pure deterministic substrate |
| Hyperbolic Duality | Deterministic curvature generation |
| Elliptic Boundary | Deterministic containment & revocation |
| Unified Curvature Invariant | Deterministic additivity |
| Curvature Scale Invariance | Deterministic scaling behavior |
| JHI Clause | Deterministic hybrid lineage |
| BLVDB | Deterministic replication & consensus |
| Pneuma | Deterministic execution |
| Θ | Deterministic classification |

## **13. Ratification Statement**

The Deterministic Constitutional Compute Doctrine is hereby RATIFIED as a binding constitutional law of ISA Fabric v5.3.1. It governs the execution, replication, classification, lineage, and memory of the organism, ensuring that all constitutional behavior is deterministic, reproducible, and consensus‑safe.

This doctrine SHALL remain in force under Article II (Non‑Regression) and SHALL govern all future versions, including v6 and beyond.
